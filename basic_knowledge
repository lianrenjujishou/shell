    **. a.if any questions, thinking about whether single/double quotes are missing;
        b.after while and until often follow by test or [] or [[]]
        c.if any questions, thinking about whether variable is not initialized before using

declare a variables:
    let var=value       #between var and value the white space can't appear;and in this form, value can be a arithmetic expression
        let a=0
	let a=[$]a+1   # equal to a=$(([$]a+1)) or ((a=i[$]a+1))
    var=value    # in this form, value only a single value can't be a expression
delcare a function:
    [function] func_name(){
        commands
    }
pass argments to a function:
    func_name arg1 arg2 ...    # arguments referenced in $1,$2,... in func body
    *.we can't reference script arguments in func body directly, if we want reference script arugments in func body we can pass $n as a func arguments,then reference in func body, for example:
        yang_script 1 2 3 4
	yang_func $3      # we can use $1 in func body to reference yang_script's $3 
pass arguments to a script:    
    script_name arg1 arg2 ...  # arguments referenced in $1,$2,... in script
    
how to a arithmetic operation then assign to a variable:
    a=$(([$]var+1))
    ((a=[$]var+1))
how to assign a variable with the result of commands:
    a=$(command[|commands])
    a=`command[|commands]`
how to group commands:
    ([ ]command[command;]...[; ])
    { command[;command]...;[ ]}
    *.the difference both above two groups are () will fork a shell to execute commands and {} execute commands in current shell, so the results of () will not affect current shell , {} opposite. that is whether environment variables and variables assignments will affect follows commands  # for example, PATH
complex variable operation:
  replace operator:
    ${varname:-word} #if varname exist and not null then return varname value,if not return word
    ${varname:=word} #if varname exist and not null then return varname value, if not define varname with word and return word
    ${varname:?message} #if varname exist and not null then return varname value,if not return message and exit current script,if message ignored,then return 
"parameter null or not set"

    ${varname:+word} # if varname exist and not null then return word ,if not return null
  pattern match operator:
    ${varname#pattern} #if pattern match the head of varname value, then truncate the minimum match and return the remains
    ${varname##pattern} #if pattern match the head of varname value, then truncate the maximum match and return the remains
    ${varname%pattern} #if pattern match the end of varname value, then truncate the minimum match and return the remains
    ${varname%%pattern} # if pattern match the end of varname value, then truncate the maximum match and return remains
    ${varname/pattern/string} #replace only the first appear
    ${varname//pattern/string} #replace all appear
    ${varname/#pattern/string} #repalce the  start of varname value only
    ${varname/%pattern/string} #repalce the  end of varname value only
    ${<@|*>/a/b} #replace each of $@ then return the replaced list. # and % is available

test:
    https://github.com/lianrenjujishou/Documentation_Manual/blob/master/linuxcommandset/test(no%20finished)(1).txt
multiple conditions:
    [[ expression ]] #expression same as test or [ ], but [[]] can use logic symbol &&,||,! and ==,!= for pattern match, and =~ for regex match
    *. space is very important with in [[]], almost everywhere
strong reference:
    '' # so-called "strong reference" means the variable will not be replace with its value within the ''
weak reference:
    "" # so-called "wealk reference" means the variable will be replace with its value within the ""

$x:
    $0: name of the shell script
    $1,$2...: positional arguments of shell script
    $*:represent all positonal argments as one string
    $@:pass all positonal arguments from $1
    $$: process id of current running shell script
    $?:exit status of last command
    $#:the number of positonal arguments passed to shell script
    $!:the last process id background
    $-:echo shell current options, the same as set command
